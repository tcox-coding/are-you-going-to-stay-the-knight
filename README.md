# [Are You Going To Stay the Knight?](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6lqwazBExeQF7KcHmFrysK)

I know that we are upside down

So hold your tongue and hear me out

I know that we were made to break

So what? I don't mind

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds

Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes

I know that we were made to break

So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Doesn't mean we're bound for life

So, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Doesn't mean we're bound for life

So, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?

I am a fire, you're gasoline

Come pour yourself all over me

We'll let this place go down in flames

Only one more time

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds

Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes

I know that we were made to break

So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight? (When we get burned)

Doesn't mean we're bound for life (we never learn)

So, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?

knight, knight, knight, knight, knight

knight, knight, knight, knight, knight

knight, knight, knight, knight, knight

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Doesn't mean we're bound for life

So, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Are you gonna stay the knight?

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna stay the knight?
